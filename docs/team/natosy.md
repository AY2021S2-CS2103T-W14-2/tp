## Project: BudgetBaby

BudgetBaby is a desktop budget tracking application used to manage finances. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability view statistics for a particular month.
    * What it does: allows the user to view the categories that they have spent within the month, sorted according to amount spent on each category.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to get a quick glance on their spending amounts and get an idea on where they are able to start saving.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability view statistics for the past few months.
  * What it does: allows the user to view the total expenditure that they have spent for the past 6 months.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to get a quick glance on their spendings for the past few months, and is able to view their progress.
  
* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Formatted all tips in the document to reflect notes on parameters for every function.
        * Made corrections for mistakes in unchanged sections.
        * Elaborated usage of all functions in the application.
