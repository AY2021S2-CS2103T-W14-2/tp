## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
University student who needs to manage their finances.

**Value proposition**: <br>
Most university students have a limited budget every month and are moving towards financial independence. 
During this transition, university students may seek external tools to manage their finances. 
Hence, we believe a budget tracker application that records monthly expenses would benefit university 
students as they adjust themselves, easing into adulthood.

* Optimised for university students by
    * setting monthly psending goals as university students have limited budgets 
    * allowing university students to categorize their spendings with custom tags suiting their diverse lifestyles
    * providing statistics to help university students better visualize their spending habits and make future plans 
      (i.e. to cut down on costs incurred on food next month)
    * sending reminders to keep university students on track (i.e. how much money is left in their budget) as they are often busy with school
