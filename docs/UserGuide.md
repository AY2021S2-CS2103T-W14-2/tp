## 5 Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are arguments which must be supplied by you when you type in a command.<br>
  For example, in the command `add-fr d/FR_DESCRIPTION a/FR_AMOUNT`, `FR_DESCRIPTION` and `FR_AMOUNT` are arguments
  which must be supplied by you. An example of supplied arguments look like this `add-fr d/Lunch a/10`.

- You may choose to omit items in square brackets as they are optional.<br>
  For example, with the command `add-fr d/FR_DESCRIPTION a/FR_AMOUNT [t/DATE] [c/CATEGORY]…`, you may omit the category and
  use `add-fr d/Lunch a/10 t/01-01-2021 c/food` or `add-fr d/Lunch a/10`.

- For items suffixed with `…`​ you may repeat it multiple times within the command.<br>
  For example, with the command `add-fr d/FR_DESCRIPTION a/FR_AMOUNT [t/DATE] [c/CATEGORY]…`, you may repeat `[c/FR_CATEGORY]…​` multiple
  times with `c/food`, `c/transportation`, `c/shopping` etc.

- You may key in arguments in any order.<br>
  For example, you can use `d/FR_DESCRIPTION a/FR_AMOUNT` or `a/FR_AMOUNT d/FR_DESCRIPTION` as both are acceptable.

- If an argument is expected only once in the command, but you specify multiple arguments, only the last occurrence of
  the argument is used.<br>
  For example, if you specify `d/Lunch d/Dinner`, only `d/Dinner` will be used.

- If you key in extraneous arguments for commands that do not take in arguments (such as `reset-filter`, `help` and `exit`),
  they will be ignored.<br>
  For example, if you specify `reset-filter 123`, it will be interpreted as `reset-filter`.

- If you key in extraneous spaces before or after an argument, these spaces will be trimmed.
  If you key in multiple spaces in the middle of an argument that takes in text (such as `FR_DESCRIPTION` and `CATEGORY`),
  these multiple spaces will be compressed into one space.<br>
  For example, if you specify `add-fr d/ bubble tea a/10.0 c/ food `,
  it will be interpreted as `add-fr d/bubble tea a/10.0 c/food`.

</div>

### 5.1 Viewing help : `help`

If this is your first time opening BudgetBaby, or if you have forgotten what commands you can use, you may utilise the `help`

- You must replace `FR_AMOUNT` with a **positive number** containing up to **two decimal places**. The upper limit for `FR_AMOUNT`is 1,000,000.
- If you key in additional decimal places for `FR_AMOUNT`, it will be rounded to two decimal places, and the value after rounding
  must be within the valid range (between 0 to 1,000,000). For example, `0.001` will be rejected, as it will be rounded to `0.00`(not positive).

- `FR_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed financial record list.
- `FR_INDEX` must be a **positive integer** (e.g. 1, 2, 3, …​)

  command, all existing categories will be replaced by the new input categories.
- Use `c/` (leave `CATEGORY` blank) to completely remove existing categories of a record.
- For the specifications on `FR_DESCRIPTION`, `FR_AMOUNT`, `DATE` and `CATEGORY`, please refer to `add-fr` command.
